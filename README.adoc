# LLM-generated-SPARQL

Experiments on generating SPARQL in different ways.

## Data evaluator

The data evaluator is a tool that can be used to evaluate the quality of the generated SPARQL queries. 
It is developed in Python and uses the `streamlib` library.

### Usage

#### Run with plain Python

The data evaluator can be used by running the following command.

```bash
python3 -m streamlit run data-evaluator-ui.py 
```

This will open a browser window with the data evaluator interface. 

#### Run with Docker

The data evaluator can also be run using Docker. To do this, run the following command:

```bash
docker build -t data-evaluator .
docker run -p 8501:8501 data-evaluator -t data-evaluator-container 
```
