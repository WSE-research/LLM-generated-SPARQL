It is a fundamental step in filtering out non-human entities like movies or fictional characters which might otherwise be included if we didn't specify this condition explicitly.

Correction: ?country wdt:P451 wd:Q425987; // has currency Euro (Q425987), indicating the country adopted the Euro. This is more aligned with the query's intent to find countries that have adopted the Euro within the European Union context, though it doesn't explicitly check EU membership but focuses on Euro adoption as requested in a corrected approach for clarity and precision towards the question asked directly about adopting the Euro rather than being an EU member state broadly without currency specification. For exact alignment with the query's intent to find countries that adopted the Euro within the European Union context, we should focus on both conditions: membership and currency use.
